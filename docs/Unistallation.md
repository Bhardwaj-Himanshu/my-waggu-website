# 2. Remove the Demo app

Once youâ€™ve experimented with the demo app and are ready to build your pages via your own app you can remove the demo app if you choose.

`PROJECT_ROOT` should be where your project is located (e.g. `/usr/local/django`) and `PROJECT` is the name of your project (e.g. `mywagtail`):

```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT=/usr/local/django
export PROJECT=mywagtail
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/$PROJECT
./manage.py sqlclear demo | psql -Upostgres $PROJECT -f -
psql -Upostgres $PROJECT << EOF
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM wagtailcore_site WHERE root_page_id IN (SELECT id FROM wagtailcore_page WHERE content_type_id IN (SELECT id FROM django_content_type where app_label='demo'));
DELETE FROM wagtailcore_page WHERE content_type_id IN (SELECT id FROM django_content_type where app_label='demo');
DELETE FROM auth_permission WHERE content_type_id IN (SELECT id FROM django_content_type where app_label='demo');
DELETE FROM django_content_type WHERE app_label='demo';
DELETE FROM wagtailimages_rendition;
DELETE FROM wagtailimages_image;
COMMIT;
EOF
rm -r demo media/images/* media/original_images/*
perl -pi -e"s/('demo',|WAGTAILSEARCH_RESULTS_TEMPLATE)/#\1/" $PROJECT/settings/base.py
```
